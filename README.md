# About

Album Scrobbler is a desktop application that allows for the
quick scrobbling of albums, or collections of selected songs
on [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/). This is especially useful for people
who listen to music in a way that doesn't get automatically 
scrobbled, or who have issues with an auto-scrobbler breaking
from time to time.

Version 1.0 is coming soon. I am shooting for before August to get the full release out, but we'll see how fast I can get it done.

# How to Run

Currently, this software is not as polished and featured as I would
like it to be for a full release, so I do not have executables prepared.
Proceed if you are okay with using the command line.

First, make sure you have `npm` installed. If you are not scared
of using the command line, you can figure out how to do this from
google: it is too many steps for me to lay out here. Next, navigate to
the directory that `package-lock.json` is located in, and run
`npm install`. Now, to run the program just run `npm start`. This
should start the program. Note that the database file is the one
I am using for testing, so you will have a bunch of random albums
in the collection tab.
